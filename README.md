# most-occurence
Retrieves the character with the most occurences in a string.

This problem was asked in a coding interview question, so I decided to upload my own solution of it.

# How does this script work?
This script works by converting the string to an array, iterating over it, and continuously pushing each letter as the key and its number of occurences as the value to an object. Then the object's keys are sorted descendingly according to their values. Afterwards, the first key of the object is returned.
